# Exploratory Data Analysis of World Health Stats- 2020 Dataset

## Introduction

- Life expectancy gives an indication of how long a population is expected to live on average. 

- But Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) reveals the true health of a population. It's about both length of life and quality of life. Not just the number of years the average person lives, but the number of years they can expect to live in good health.

## Objective

To visualize the data by generalizing the plots into 2 main category -
- World demographics on a timeline
- World vs Region vs India trend

## Conclusion:
### India vs World
- India's Life Expectancy and Healthy Life Expectancy has improved over a period of time. But Average life expectancy and HALE of India has remained low compared to the other countries of the World and SE Asia Region
- India ranks 117 compared to 184 countries of the world in 2019 with Life Expectancy of 70 years.
- India ranks 9th in Life Expectancy when compared with the 11 countries in SE Asian region
- India's rank with respect to Life Expectancy and Healthy Life Expectancy has improved but the trend for Healthy Life Expectancy is not in line with Life Expectancy from 2015 to 2019.
- Both Males and Females in India have lower average Life Expectancy and Healthy Life Expectancy compared to all the countries in the world and SE Asia region

### World Trend
- All the top 20 countries have the Life Expectancy over 80 Years. Japan has consistently been on top for 10 years from 2000 to 2019. Republic of Korea has shown a tremendous improvement over the years from below 20th position in 2000 to 3rd position in 2019. Germany has made its way back to top 20 in 2019 after 2000. Luxembourg had not been very consistent as it made it to 5th position in 2015 from 15th in 2000 . In 2019, it slipped to 11th position
- The Life Expectancy of bottom countries have also improved from an average of 50 Years to 60 Years from 2000 to 2019
- The gap between Healthy Life Expectancy and Life Expectancy of all the top 20 countries have remained consistently same though 2000 to 2019. It means that if the Life Expectancy has improved / diminished for these countries, even Healthy Life Expectancy has also improved/diminished
- There is bigger gap between Healthy Life Expectancy and Life Expectancy for Australia and New Zealand . It means that these countries are not doing well in terms of Healthy life expectancy even though their Life expectancy is higher compared to the other top 20 countries. Other counties such as Singapore , Israel and Republic of Korea are having better Healthy Life Expectancy compared to the countries which have higher Life Expectancy

## Actionable Insights
- Healthy Life Expectancy is the major factor to be considered which in turn could increase the Life Expectancy of a country or region.
- There could be numerous factors affecting the Life Expectancy and Healthy Life Expectancy of a country ranging from geography, cultural practices, healthcare, population, standard of living.
- India should revisit all the factors and compare it with the countries which have made a tremendous improvement and put forth such practices to improve the Life Expectancy.
